# Québec Océan data archive workshop

Slides for the [Québec Océan](https://www.quebec-ocean.ulaval.ca/) data archive workshop. This repository is updated every year before the workshop. The git repository contains branches for each year. The `main` branch is used to deploy GitHub pages with the most recent version of the workshop.

## What to improve for 2023

- Pascal took 60 min and not 30 min as expected. Allow him more time.


- My presentation:
  - Better drawning on why to keep data raw (hand drawning).
  - Change the section title called "working with others data."
  - Slide #9: add .tab and also .tsv.
  - Think if I should keep the geoJSON format?
  - Add more examples in the *file naming basic rules* section.
    - Add a vertical space between the bad and good examples.
  - Better explain what is *tidy* data witht the flower biomass example.
  - Add an example (with a red cross) of a bad file name in the *variable name* section (slide #48).
